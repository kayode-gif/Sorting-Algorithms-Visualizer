# Sorting-Algorithm-Visualiser 

Introducing My Sorting Visualiser! 
I built this web application to practice my recent learns of javascript and also revise implementing sorting algorithms from scratch. I included popular and unpopular ones to see how various sorting algorithms behave when visualised.

NOTE: This was done before knowledge of React and how classes operate in Javascript. 

These are the implemented algorithms below:

- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Shell Sort
- Gnome Sort
- Cocktail Shaker Sort
